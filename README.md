# Next.js URL as State

This is a Proof of Concept (POC) web application demonstrating how to use the **URL as state** in a Next.js app to filter and manage Orders in an admin panel.

Instead of using `useState` to track filter values, this approach leverages the URL query parameters. This has several benefits:

- Enable shareable and bookmarkable links
- Improve UX with better navigation and deep linking

## Features

- Filter orders using query parameters
- Keep state in the URL â€” no extra global or local state needed
- Navigate directly to filtered views via links

## Notes:

- Currently using Custom hook to update URL state when click. Will implement a more robust way to handle this via [NUQS](https://nuqs.47ng.com/).
